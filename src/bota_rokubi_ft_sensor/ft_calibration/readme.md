# FT calibration scripts
Reads csv file with joint values of kinova arm for the calibration orientations of the FT sensor. Jogs the robot to those poses one by one. At each point, Subscribes to the IMU messages and Wrench msgs reads them 100 times, takes the average (Note that from IMU, only the accelerations are needed, however they need to be on the same frame with wrench, so make sure they are published in the same frame, eg use a IMU transformer). After the averaging data is collected for that point with a matrix. After the all data is collected, a least squares estimate is used to estimate the sensor offsets (Fx,Fy,Fz,Tx,Ty,Tz) end effector mass(m) and center of mass coordintes in wrench frame (cx, cy, cz) is calculated and exported to a yaml file. This yaml file later can be used with a gravity compansation node to remove the static errors on the FT sensor.
